# Viral Mask Construction

**Inspiration:** https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2020/03/20/calling-all-people-who-sew-and-make-you-can-help-solve-2020-n95-type-mask-shortage/#13b05e104e41

While a multi-layer cloth facemask is better than nothing. I believe we can do better than a 10% - 67% fit. This is a request for assistance in developing home-accessible methods of introducing better defenses against viral particulates to DIY face masks.


## Possible Improvements

Below are the 4 layers used in manufacturing N95 masks, with a brief attempt at describing their composition and function.

### Outer Layer

**Material:** Spun-bond Polypropylene

**Coating:** Hydrophilic Plastic (citric acid 2% w/w, & a pH-lowering agent)

*This material is readily available online. Substitute should not be needed.*


### Second Layer

**Material:** Cellulose/Polyester

**Coating:** Copper & Zinc Ions (copper 1.6% w/w, zinc 1.6% w/w)
Purpose: Neutralize Viral particulates

*I'm unsure how/what to substitute this material. It may be available to purchase. Any material of sufficient density that can have Copper & Zinc ions bonded to it should work.*


### Third Layer

**Material:** Melt-blown Polypropylene filter material (50g/m^2 meltblown polypropylene [meets NIOSH Respirator Certification])

**Purpose:** Physical Particle Filtration (must be .1 - .3 micron filtration)

*This is a physical filter and will have to be purchased. I have not found a suitable substitute.*


### Fourth Layer (Inner)

**Material:** Spun-bound Polypropylene

**Purpose:** Comforth & barrier between wearer's face & filter materials

*Same material as Layer 1, should be easily sourced.*
